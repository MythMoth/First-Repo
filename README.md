# First-Repo

This is my first Repository and program that I made on GitHub! 
I'm doing the 100 days of code Python Bootcamp on Udemy, and this is day 1 of coding.
I'm planning on uploading my progress to GitHub daily to build up my portfolio

# Today I learned about:
- Variables
- Input Statements
- Print Statements
